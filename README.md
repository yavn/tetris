tetris
======

Basic tetris-like game in Clojure

The aim of this project is to practice writing Clojure programs.
Uses Leiningen, to run execute "lein run" in the project directory.

The program is rather simple so I put all the code in the single namespace.
Most of the code was written test-first so take a look at the tests too.
I intentionally put in a lot of comments to document things I found
cool, interesting, or otherwise worth noting.
